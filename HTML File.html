    <!-- image map not working. works with defualt shape for whole image, but appears it can't find the coordinates for rect
    should be format x1,y1,x2,y2 but ushing mac paintbrush, it gives me screen coordinates not image coordinates
    *** i ended up using a free online HTML coordinate generator where you just upload the image and select the points and it
    generates the coordiantes, even for compelx poly shapes -->

<!-- this is the line-out format for HTML -->
<!-- 'head' contains meta information bout the HTML page -->
<!-- 'title' tag defines the title of the document, shown in browsers title bar-->
<!-- 'body' is container for all visible components -->
<!-- new project created in IntelliJ with HTML language. can highlight and right click to view HTML contents in a browser -->
<!-- <a> element tag with 'href' attribute allows for linking of site with the hyperlink listed as the subsequent text-->
<!-- nested elements just means a tag inside another tag, just like a header being inside a body
- 'alt' assigns text to populate if the image doesn't display properly, such as if i remove the img\ folder path
- style attribute such as color is contained in the tag <> brackets
- 'title' attribute allows for small text box to popualte when web element hovered over
- <hr> tag is an empty tag (no closing tag) and just populates a line for a thematic break
- <br> is another empty tag that creates a line break
- style attributes of 'background' are actually CSS controls. with the format of 'property:value' like color:blue
- other attributes that are CSS exist: font-size, text-align, etc.
- syntax of HTML text formatting elements like <b> for bold and <strong> for italics is a little different where closing bracket
    ends with backslash first <b></b> instead of <b><b/>. many of these elements exist, small, mark, del, etc.
- more unique colors produced with RBG integers
- external CSS involves a <link> to the CSS file via the <head> tag in the HTML file where the
    CSS file must be saved as a .css extension and contains no HTML but defines styles for backgrounds, headers, etc.


CSS
- oftene in external files, but can be 'inline' and 'internal' styles
- inline CSS already used such as 'style' above where a single element affectedd
- internal is for styling a single HTML page which we have also already done when the body background color was set
- CSS, all kinds of styles. so many. borders, margins, whatever.

- can link image to a website by including img tag in the <a> hyperlink tag space
- document.location is part of the syntax for a button when will bring you to associated link. withouth
    it, and the qutoes "''" it will populate a button that doesn't do anything
- using an href and id attribute elsewhere in HTML file, can create a link that jumps to somwhere else on page. not inlcuded here

// img was not displaying properly. The issue was that i had created the project incorrectly and didn't start was an
// actual index.html file and just named it that myself. additionally, the image won't render properly if its not in a folder
// even if it is in the project folder. image must be called via its own folder 'img\schmitty.jpg'



how do i combine attributes such as color and font changes for same text?
