<!-- this is the line-out format for HTML -->
<!-- 'head' contains meta information bout the HTML page -->
<!-- 'title' tag defines the title of the document, shown in browsers title bar-->
<!-- 'body' is container for all visible components -->
<!-- new project created in IntelliJ with HTML language. can highlight and right click to view HTML contents in a browser -->
<!-- <a> element tag with 'href' attribute allows for linking of site with the hyperlink listed as the subsequent text-->
<!-- nested elements just means a tag inside another tag, just like a header being inside a body
- 'alt' assigns text to populate if the image doesn't display properly, such as if i remove the img\ folder path
- style attribute such as color is contained in the tag <> brackets
- 'title' attribute allows for small text box to popualte when web element hovered over
- <hr> tag is an empty tag (no closing tag) and just populates a line for a thematic break
- <br> is another empty tag that creates a line break
- style attributes of 'background' are actually CSS controls. with the format of 'property:value' like color:blue
- other attributes that are CSS exist: font-size, text-align, etc.
- syntax of HTML text formatting elements like <b> for bold and <strong> for italics is a little different where closing bracket
    ends with backslash first <b></b> instead of <b><b/>. many of these elements exist, small, mark, del, etc.

// img was not displaying properly. The issue was that i had created the project incorrectly and didn't start was an
// actual index.html file and just named it that myself. additionally, the image won't render properly if its not in a folder
// even if it is in the project folder. image must be called via its own folder 'img\schmitty.jpg'



how do i combine attributes such as color and font changes for same text?
